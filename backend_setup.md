# How to Connect Your Backend (Step-by-Step)

Follow these 4 simple steps to get your app working.

### Step 1: Create a Free Account
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Click **"Start your project"**.
3. Sign in with GitHub (or create an account).
4. Click **"New Project"**.
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Meal App"), a password, and choose a region near you.
6. Click **"Create new project"** and wait about a minute for it to finish setting up.

### Step 2: Set up the Database (Copy & Paste)
1. In your new Supabase project dashboard, look at the left sidebar.
2. Click on the icon that looks like a terminal/code called **"SQL Editor"**.
3. Click inside the empty text box.
4. Copy the code below:

```sql
create table orders (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  customer_name text,
  items jsonb,
  total_amount numeric,
  status text
);

alter table orders enable row level security;

create policy "Enable insert for all users" on "public"."orders"
as permissive for insert
to public
with check (true);
```

5. Paste it into the editor and click the green **"RUN"** button.
6. You should see "Success" in the results.

### Step 3: Get Your Keys
1. In the Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** (gear icon at the bottom of the left bar).
2. Click on **"API"**.
3. You will see a box that says `Project URL` and another `Project API keys`.
4. Keep this tab open, you need these for the next step.

### Step 4: Connect Your App
1. Go back to your code editor (VS Code).
2. Open the file named `.env` in your project folder (`meal-ordering-app`).
3. It currently looks like this:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=INSERT_YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE
   ```
4. Replace `INSERT_YOUR_SUPABASE_URL_HERE` with the **Project URL** from Step 3.
5. Replace `INSERT_YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE` with the **anon / public** key from Step 3.
6. Save the file (`Ctrl + S`).

### Final Step: Re-run the App
1. In your VS Code terminal, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the app if it's running.
2. Type `npm.cmd run dev` and press Enter.
3. Open the app link. Now when you order, it works!
